                        <p>EthCrash is a clone of the extremely popular bitcoin game Bustabit. While the rules and math are exactly the same,
                        EthCrash is built to be played with Ethereum. This gives you much lower transaction fees, confirmation times, and the
                        ability to play almost instantly! EthCrash is <a href="https://www.bustabit.com/license.txt">licensed</a> by BaB and has been modified to run on Ethereum.

                        On your <a href="/account">account</a> page, you can transfer Ethos to any Ethereum address you want automatically. Withdrawals smaller than the balance of our hot wallet are processed instantly and you will be given the transaction ID immediately.

                        Larger withdrawals will be shown in your withdrawal page as "PENDING" and will require us to manually remove sufficient funds from our cold storage. Usually this process will take less than two hours, but may take up to 24 hours, depending on the time of day and other circumstances.

                        We let you chose the gas price on your withdraw. This will generally cost between .03 USD and .13 USD (slow, fast) but these prices vary depending on Ethereum network activity. SlowLow transactions can take hours to confirm, if you select this option please be prepared to wait.

                        Withdrawals must be in increments of 1 ethos, with a minimum withdrawal of 400 ethos. <b>Transaction fees (gasPrice * amount of gas used) will be removed from your withdraw</b> By offering three gas price choices we give you the ability to choose how much you'd like to pay.

                        If the withdrawal is processed by our hot wallet it will be broadcast in less than a minute. However, the amount of time it takes to show up will depend on a number of different factors. First, let's make sure you've followed the correct withdraw steps:

                  While it's not required to have a deep understanding of how Ethereum transactions works, it's important to understand a couple basic things if you're withdrawing to an address that you don't have full control of. For example, if you tell EthCrash to withdraw your coins to Poloniex or another exchange, <b>It's completely up to them decide how many confirmations$
                  Certian exchange services might not like small fees. If you're unsure, probably best to stick with the higer fee "fast" option on the withdraw page.

                  <p>
                  Beyond that, at the time of this writing, it's common place to see large delays on deposits being made to exchanges. On average, it takes ethCrash less than 30 seconds to process your withdraw and submit it to the Ethereum network. If you've made a withdraw and are waiting for it to show up, please check the link to the transaction in your withdraw history. If$
